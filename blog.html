        <p1><h2>1.Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2></p1>
        <p> In JavaScript, the scope of variables declared with var, let, and const differs in terms of block scope, hoisting, and reassignment. 
            <h3>var Scope:</h3>
            Function Scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. They are visible and accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared, but they are not block-scoped.
            
            Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means they are moved to the top of the function during compilation, and you can use them before they are declared. However, they are initialized with undefined by default.
            
            Reassignment: Variables declared with var can be reassigned within their scope.
            <h3>let Scope:</h3>
            

            Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are visible and accessible only within the block (curly braces) in which they are declared. This includes loops, conditionals, and functions.

            Hoisting: Variables declared with let are also hoisted to the top of their containing block but are not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.

            Reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned within their block scope.

            <h3>const Scope:</h3>

            Block Scope: Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, similar to let.

            Hoisting: Like let, const variables are hoisted to the top of their containing block but are not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.

            Reassignment: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial value assignment. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be modified.

        <p><h2>2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2></p>
        <p>
            null and undefined are two distinct values in JavaScript, and they are typically used for different purposes:

            <h3>undefined:</h2>
            
            Default Value: Variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value are automatically initialized with undefined. This is useful when you want to define a variable but don't yet have a specific value for it.
            
            Function Return: When a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns undefined by default.
            
            Non-existent Properties: Accessing properties or elements that do not exist in objects or arrays returns undefined.
            
            Optional Function Parameters: undefined is often used to indicate missing or omitted function arguments when a parameter is not provided.
            
            Empty Variables: undefined can be explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no meaningful value.
            
            <h3>null:</h2>
            
            Intentional Absence of Value: Unlike undefined, null is explicitly used to indicate that a variable or object property has no value or represents the absence of a value.
            
            Initializing Objects: It can be used to initialize objects or properties when you want to represent that an object or property exists but doesn't have a meaningful value yet.
            
            Clearing Values: You can assign null to variables or properties to explicitly remove or clear their values.
